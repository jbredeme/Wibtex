# WibTeX Reference Management System (WRMS)
WibTeX Reference Management System simplifies the process of preparing documents for cross-discipline research publications by eliminating the need to reconstruct bibliographic information produced in BibTeX to a format suitable for Microsoft Word. WibTeX allows the user to construct reference pages and in-text citations sourced from BibTeX bibliographic information from within a Microsoft Word Document, using a LaTeX workflow.
